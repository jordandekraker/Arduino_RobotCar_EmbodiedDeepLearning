# Arduino_RobotCar_EmbodiedDeepLearning

Repository for Kumantech SM3 Robot car python interface. The idea of this project is to have a fun, cheap, interactive platform to play around with deep learning tools. 

working: 

-webcam stream import 

-motor command output 


todo: 

-pan/tilt servo comman output 

-infrared sensor obstacle avoidance 

-put some deep learning inside! 


wishlist: 

-robot arm (x2 ?)
